```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Julnar1/amazon_clone_product_list_page.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.

## Note on Interactivity

This project is primarily focused on UI replication with minimal JavaScript functionality. The interactive elements (filters, sorting, cart) are implemented with basic JavaScript for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, these would be connected to a backend API and database.

## Future Enhancements

If this project were to be expanded, the following features could be implemented:
- Full shopping cart functionality with a backend
- User authentication
- Product detail pages
- Checkout process
- Search functionality with API integration
